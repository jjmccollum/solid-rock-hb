## About the Book

From the back cover:

> While scribes have transmitted the Hebrew Bible in its original languages with extraordinary care for millennia, no one copyist can be expected to have escaped all error. The surviving tradition has accumulated many points of variation over time, and some of these pose unavoidable challenges for translation and exegesis. In many other ancient works, new editions based on a critical assessment of variant readings have offered valuable insights to interpreters, but readers of the Hebrew Bible have so far not had this benefit.

> The _Solid Rock Hebrew Bible_ aims to remedy this situation. Based on investigation of various masoretic manuscripts, ancient manuscripts from the Judean wilderness, the ancient versions, and other sources, this edition prints the entire Hebrew text (in a traditional two-column layout and an easy-to-read 13-point font, with vowel points included for readers' convenience) and includes adjustments made to the base text (the Leningrad Codex) in over 2,500 places. Additionally, over 2,000 other adjustments have been made to the diacritics. Pastors, scholars, translators, and others readers of the Hebrew Bible will stand to benefit from this work.

The _Solid Rock Hebrew Bible_ is available in two printed volumes at Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999532227 and https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999532235) and other booksellers.

## About the Editor

**Stephen L. Brown** began studying biblical Hebrew in his early teen years, and later set about studying other languages (particularly biblical Aramaic and Greek) as well as textual criticism of a variety of works, particularly the Old and New Testaments. He served for five years as a pastor at First Baptist Church in North Conway, NH, and currently lives in Philadelphia, PA.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the digital infrastructure behind the _Solid Rock Hebrew Bible_.
For those interested in analyzing and augmenting the underlying collation between this edition and the Unicode/XML Leningrad
Codex, v1.6, the files of primary interest are the TEI XML transcription and collation files in the `xml` directory.
For those interested in some ancillary tools developed for converting, normalizing, and collating transcriptions and transforming TEI XML collations into ConTeXt files, these tools can be found in the `py` directory.
(Be warned that these scripts may seem unpolished, as they were designed for private use.)
Finally, for those interested in the typeset work, the ConTeXt files used to generate this can be found in the `tex` directory.
If you are looking for PDFs of both volumes of this work, you can find them in the `tex/vol_1` and `tex/vol_2` subdirectories.

The Hebrew typeface used for this work is a slightly modified version of Yoram Gnat's Keter YG; it is maintained in a separate repo at https://github.com/jjmccollum/Keter-YG.
